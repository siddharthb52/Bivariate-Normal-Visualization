# Bivariate-Normal-Visualization
A 3D visualization of Bivariate Normal Distribution using the plotly and numpy libraries.

A user can enter the means and standard deviations of 2 Normally Distributed variables X and Y, along with their covariance. Upon doing so, an interactive 3D visualization of the distribution is created. Viewing the visualization from the side, with either the x or y axis parallel to the viewer's screen will show the individual Normal distributions. From an angle, the viewer can see how the covariance value affects the interaction between the two separate Normal distributions.
